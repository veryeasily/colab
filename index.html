                <p class="section__text--large">CoLab began with a group of friends purchasing a 16.5 acre property purchased in Gainesboro, TN in 2013. Initially, their interest was in shared learning about construction, sustainable design, and ethical lifestyles. Soon after, it became obvious many other friends and colleagues were interested in cultivating the land and collaborating with those involved. Currently, we have about 30 active members who volunteer labor, run art and writing retreats, and attend our annual conference.</p>

                <h2 class="section__heading">What We Do</h2>
                <p class="section__text--large">Colab has two primary functions: 1) develop and utilize the shared property in Gainesboro and 2) facilitating and growing the projects and goals of those involved. The land is a dedicated gathering space that offers opportunities for learning, relaxing, and doing focused work. Land projects aim toward expanding these potentials of the property while working with values of minimal environmental impact and DIY enjoyment. Outside of land stewardship, CoLab attempts to support the genesis and growth of new projects that may or may not actually stay within our organization. With our pool of diversely talented individuals, we like networking like-minds and offering support for good ideas.</p>

                <p class="section__text--large">Projects that grew from CoLab include:</p>
